# CNLU-EG (Creative NLU-Example Generation)

CNLU-EG is a method for creatively generating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) examples from discrete short sentences, using chain-of-thought prompting and an automatic scoring mechanism to construct pretraining datasets in [Reason] + [Example] format. 

This process assists in training smaller models to learn more effectively. 

This method is inspired by the Tree-of-thought's creative writing, as described by [citation](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm).
